            <h2>Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery
                and many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by
                boat is common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest shared with Eastern
                India, is home to the royal Bengal tiger. Bangladesh did not exist as an independent state until 1971. Willem van Schendel's state-of-the-art history navigates the extraordinary twists and turns that created modern Bangladesh through ecological disaster, colonialism, partition, a war of independence and cultural renewal.</p>
                <p>Bangladesh officially known as the People's Republic of Bangladesh is an independent nation located in South Asia. It makes up the eastern and largest portion of the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal. It is situated at the zenith of the Bay of Bengal and is bordered by Myanmar and India, and separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the thin Siliguri Corridor.</p>
